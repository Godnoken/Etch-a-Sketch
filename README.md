What will I make;

"Etch-a-Sketch" project according to TheOdinProjects rules found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project

What I will learn;

More DOM manipulation, JavaScript and CSS.

How will I do it;

Initialize a 16x16 square grid as a div called "squareGrid" using CSS Grid and append it to the body
    Add id "squareGrid"

Initialize divs inside the container with a loop
    Add an event listener change the div(s) background color on hover

Initialize a button that clears the entire grid when clicked
    Add a prompt that asks the user for how many squares they want for their new grid. Limit at 40 for performance
    Add a function that reads the user's input and creates a new grid in the same space as the previous one
